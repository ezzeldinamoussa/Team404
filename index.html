    <h1>Accountability App</h1>
    <p>Functionality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Set tasks and goals for the next day, a simple one-day-at-a-time planner
        that is gameified
      </li>
      <li>
        For each task completed, you get a point. For 75% of all tasks done or
        higher for that day, your daily streak continues
      </li>
      <li>
        Add friends who can see your points and streaks, view leadership board,
        etc. You and your friend can also complete a task together for double
        points
      </li>
      <li>
        Rewards: With points you can buy profile badges like on discord, or
        other stuff, like a lifeline, allowing you to skip a task, or revive a
        broken streak for a higher cost, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        A restriction would be that the tasks you set for tomorrow cannot be
        removed after 11:59 today but can still add more tasks for today.
      </li>
    </ul>
